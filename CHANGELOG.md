## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-11

### Enhanced
- **Channel Joining Efficiency**: Major performance improvement to auto-join functionality for inactive channel detection
  - Leverages `IsMember` field from Slack API to skip channels bot is already a member of
  - Reduces API calls dramatically (from 149 join attempts to typically 0-10 actual joins needed)
  - Prevents unnecessary rate limiting during channel analysis operations
  
### Improved  
- **User Experience**: Enhanced auto-join reporting with clearer status messages
  - Shows exactly how many channels need joining vs already member of (e.g., "Joining 5 channels (already member of 144)")
  - Displays "Already member of all X channels, no joining needed" when no joins are required
  - Provides "No channel joining required" confirmation when appropriate
  - Better progress feedback reduces user confusion about join operations

### Fixed
- **API Efficiency**: Eliminated redundant join attempts that were causing rate limit issues
